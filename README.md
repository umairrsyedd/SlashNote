# SlashNote

> A Notion-like Editor built with Svelte (in just 1 week at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/ "Recurse Center")!)
> A quick and lightweight editor for jotting down your thoughts and ideas, inspired by Notion's intuitive block-based interface.

## Current Features:

- Type away with markdown-like syntax (# Heading 1, ## Heading 2, - List items, etc.)
- Create new blocks with a slash (/) command and explore various types (headings, lists, code)
- Track your word and character count as you write

## Looking Forward:

- Navigate and select blocks using your keyboard arrows
- More block types (quotes, images, tables) and enhanced customization options
- Session/local storage for persistent note-taking
- Font selection and other UI tweaks
- Drag and rearrange blocks for flexible organization
- Integration with cool features like Lorem Ipsum generation and inline editing

## Notes & Learnings:

- This project was a whirlwind week of building, learning, and iterating! ️
- If you think debugging backend code is tough, wait till you try untangling frontend state.
- Separating presentation from data proved crucial for clean architecture.
- Reducing scope was (and often is!) the hardest battle. Focus on your timeline!
- User stories are your friends for scoping and delivering value.
- Bad days happen. Take breaks, sleep it off, and come back stronger.
